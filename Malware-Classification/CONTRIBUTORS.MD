# Usman

1. Did Naive Bayes classification with a CV of ~85% using 2-GRAMS on Bytes files. Applying TFIDF may have improved the score but didn't pursue that route any further

2. Extracted OPCODES feature vectors from all the files

3. Extracted SEGMENTS feature vectors from all the files

4. Assembled the two vectors together in the SVMLIB format

5. Ran Random Forest classification for final results

# Yang 

1. Successfully extracted 2-Grams feature vectors from Bytes file. 

2. Setup EC2 cluster and ran the job


# Chirag

1. Successfully extracted 2-3 Grams feature vectors using MLLIB

2. Transformed the features into feature vectors using count vectorizer

3. Applied Random Forest classifier using DataFrames and Pipelines
